#### About me
I am Richard Victor Martins Tenorio long name huh ? I was born in Brazil in 1999. I went to Switzerland when I was five years old. Since, I am doing my education with the swissy culture and it's very nice so far !
Like every children of my generation I started using computers very early and of course started playing video games even more sooner.
It was at the end of my obligatory school that I found the love I have now for Computer Science.
Ever since I am always pushing my limits in that domain.

#### My projects
>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
