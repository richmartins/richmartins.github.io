    <p>
        I am <b>Richard Victor Martins Tenorio</b> long name huh ?<br />
        I was born in <b>Brazil</b> in <b>1999</b>. I went to Switzerland when I was five years old. Since, I have been doing my education with the swissy culture and it's very nice so far !<br /><br />
        Like every child of my generation I started using computers very early and of course started playing video games even more sooner.<br />
        It was at the end of my obligatory school that I found the love I have now for Computer Science.<br />
        Ever since I am always pushing my limits in that domain.<br />

    <ul>
        <li>2004 -> 2014
        <p>
        I did my obligatory school in Lausanne, VD.
        </p></li>
        <li>2014 -> 2015
        <p>
        I did what we call here a <b>RACC</b>.
        </p></li>
        <li>2015 -> 2016
        <p>
        It's where I began studying IT at <a href="https://www.etml.ch"><b>ETML</b></a>. Which is a very good school by the way. But I didn't want to do my <b>CFC</b> in a school. I wanted to have responsibility and see how the industry world works. So I just did what we call a "Pr√©apprentissage" there.
        </p></li>
        <li>2016 -> 2020
        <p>
        It's where I am now as a trainee CFC IT level 1 support at <a href="https://epfl.ch"><b>EPFL</b></a>, one of the best university in europe.
        </p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I have planned to do a Bachelor after at the <a href="https://heig-vd.ch"><b>HEIG</b></a> in Yverdon.
