    <h4 id="about-me">About me</h4>
    <p>
        I am Richard Victor Martins Tenorio long name huh ?<br />
        I was born in Brazil in 1999. I went to Switzerland when I was five years old. Since, I am doing my education with the swissy culture and it's very nice so far !<br />
        Like every children of my generation I started using computers very early and of course started playing video games even more sooner.<br />
        It was at the end of my obligatory school that I found the love I have now for Computer Science.<br />
        Ever since I am always pushing my limits in that domain.<br />

        It's where I began studying IT at <a href="https://www.etml.ch"><b>ETML</b></a>. Which is a very good school by the way. But I didn't wanted to do my <b>CFC</b> in a school. I wanted to have responsability and see how the industry world works. So I just did what we call a "Pr√©apprentissage" there.
        </p></li>
        <li>2016 => 2020
        <p>
        It's where I am now as a trainee CFC IT level 1 support at <a href="https://epfl.ch"><b>EPFL</b></a>, one of the best university in europe.
