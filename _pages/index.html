    <span id="intro">
        I am <b>Richard Victor Martins Tenorio</b> long name huh ? I was born in <b>Brazil</b> in <b>1999</b>. I came to Switzerland when I was five years old. Since then, I have been getting an education within the swissy culture and it's been very nice so far !<br /><br />
        Like every child of my generation I started using computers very early and of course started playing video games even more sooner. It was at the end of my obligatory school that I feel in love with Computer Science. Ever since I have always been pushing my limits in that domain. Particularly in web developpement

          I began studying IT at <a href="https://www.etml.ch"><b>ETML</b></a>. Which is a very good school by the way. But I didn't want to do my <b>CFC</b> in a school. I wanted to have responsibility and see how the industry world works. I did a " Pr√©apprentissage " there.
